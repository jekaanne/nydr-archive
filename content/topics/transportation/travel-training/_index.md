If people don’t know how to travel, they can’t access transportation. Most people learn to travel by going places with their family or on school trips. Sometimes we assume people know how to travel, but it's not always easy. Information and signs can be confusing. Directions can be hard without clear landmarks or at different times of day. It's easy to get distracted and miss a bus stop or get lost.

Some people benefit from training to help them travel independently. Travel training covers all types of transportation and teaches every part of a journey. A method for training anyone to travel was first developed in NYC in the 1960s and has become a model for other cities.

## Travel Planning

When traveling somewhere new, you need to know how to plan your journey. Some trips involve many steps or require different types of transportation. With good planning, which means you know all the steps in advance, traveling can be less stressful. Street crossing skills are essential for any trip in the city.

## Navigating and understanding signage

Subways, buses, and streets each have their own system of information, so people can figure out which way to go. Streets have names or numbers. Buses and subways have different routes to take you to various places. To carry out a travel plan, you have to know what different signs mean.

## Communicating and Asking for Help

It’s easy to get lost or turned around in some places, so it’s good to know who to ask if you need help. Other passengers might be able to help, but sometimes they don’t know the right information. Transportation workers usually wear uniforms or work in specific locations so they are easier to find.

## Safety and situational awareness

Traveling anywhere requires awareness of your surroundings. Sometimes people don’t notice dangerous conditions, like potholes or other hazards. Moving vehicles don’t always follow the traffic rules. Other people can sometimes cause harm. Travel training teaches people how to stay safe while traveling.

Most subways were built in the 1930s, before wheelchair access was considered important. After World War II, veterans pushed for accessible public transportation laws, but officials said it would cost too much.

Advocates first requested access to important stations connecting to buses and paratransit. After the ADA passed, the number of key stations increased. The ADA required renovated station entrances to be made accessible. Train stations were updated first because they were cheaper to fix. The ADA also required new standards for platform gaps and tactile warnings for cane users. Advocates with vision and hearing disabilities pushed for better communication systems.

Activists sued the MTA in 2016 after many subway stations were renovated without elevators. In 2022, they achieved a victory requiring 95% accessibility over a 33-year period.

## Activism Milestones

- 1968: The Architectural Barriers Act required agencies that receive federal funds to make buildings wheelchair accessible.
- 1979 Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association filed a lawsuit to stop renovations at stations that didn’t include elevators.  
- 1984: The city and MTA agreed to add elevators to 54 key subway stations.
- 1990: The U.S. Access Board begins creating accessibility standards for facilities and transportation systems.  
- 1994: New York lawmakers sign a law to increase the number of key stations in the subway to 100.
- 2016: Digital information screens were installed in subway stations.
- 2017: A lawsuit was filed by activists, taking on the inaccessibility of the entire subway instead of a single station.
- 2022: The MTA agreed to make 95% of the remaining subway stations accessible by 2055.

## Key Stations

In 1983, a New York senator introduced a law to make 27 key subway stations accessible. EPVA’s lawsuit resulted in an agreement for 54 key stations the next year. The ADA defined key stations as transfer points, end stations, and high ridership stations, and required cities to create key station plans. After the ADA passed, lawmakers increased the MTA’s number of key stations to 100, but that only represented about 20% of stations.

## Tactile edges and the gap

High contrast tactile edges help keep blind people safe by providing a warning at the edge of the platform. The gap between the platform and the car is a barrier for people who use wheeled mobility devices. After the ADA, the MTA added accessible boarding areas, which have a smaller gap. LIRR and NJ Transit use bridge plates to get wheelchair users over the gap.

## Audible and visible announcements

After the ADA, advocates urged better announcements of vehicle arrivals and service changes. Clear audible and visible travel information helps people travel with confidence. This is especially important for people with disabilities. The Hearing Loss Association of America's New York chapter pushed for digital signage on buses and subway platforms.

## Elevator Action Group

The Elevator Action Group formed in 2017 because subway accessibility was a low priority. The group was made up of organizations and individuals. Some later became plaintiffs in lawsuits against the MTA. Members organized postcard campaigns, held rallies to raise awareness, and advocated directly with MTA leaders. The group continues to rally for better maintenance and notifications of outages.

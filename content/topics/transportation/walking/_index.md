Walking connects people to places and other modes of transportation. People who use wheelchairs still “walk,” and they credit their freedom and independence to their wheelchairs. Archive donor Carr Massi remembered in an oral history interview how her father built a seat he could use to carry her from place to place when she was a child (before modern wheelchairs).

New Yorkers with disabilities have long fought for the right to personal mobility and independent travel. This means having access to personal mobility devices, ramps at curbs and building entrances, and audible and tactile signals for crossing the street.

## Activism Milestones

- 1945: A veterans group asked the Kalamazoo, MI City Council to install curb cuts as a way to improve access to jobs.
- 1971: Disabled students at Brooklyn College called for ramps for sidewalks and building entrances on campus.
- 1994: EPVA sued the city for failing to meet an Americans with Disabilities Act deadline for installing curb ramps.
- 2019: After a lawsuit from the Center for the Disabled NY (CIDNY), the city agreed to make all intersections accessible by 2034, including tactile surfaces.
- 2022: The American Council of the Blind won a lawsuit against the city, which agreed to install Accessible Pedestrian Signals (APS) at all intersections by 2036.
- 2025: The “Consumer Wheelchair Repair Bill of Rights Act,” allowing wheelchair owners to make their own repairs, was introduced in the New York Senate.

## Wheelchairs and mobility devices

By the early 1970s, portable wheelchairs were widespread, and motorized wheelchairs were also in use. EPVA operated a mobile wheelchair repair clinic for many years. Since then, wheelchair repairs have become more costly and slow. Nowadays, wheelchair manufacturers control access to parts so they can bill for repairs.

## Curb Cuts

EPVA advocated for sidewalk ramps (curb cuts) after the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968. Broken sidewalks were also hazardous. After the ADA, the city was slow to make improvements. Activists took matters into their own hands during a demonstration for curb cuts.

## One Step Campaign

After the ADA passed, activists from Disabled In Action and other groups went door-to-door to visit businesses with a single step at their entrance. Armed with booklets of design solutions for different entrances, they were able to convince many owners to install ramps.

## Accessible Pedestrian Signals (APS)

Blind and deafblind pedestrians rely on audible and tactile information for navigation. Pedestrians for Accessible and Safe Streets (PASS Coalition) fought for Accessible Pedestrian Signals (APS), which are audible and vibrating signals for safe crossing.
